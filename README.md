# DungeonsAndDragons
Use the power of LLM's and ChatGPT to play single player Dungeons and Dragons. 
Choose the universe you want to play in (such as Star Wars, Marvel, The Last of Us, or even Original DND) and let your imagination run wild.

This code solves all of the regular pitfalls of using ChatGPT as a dungeon master such as:
 - forgetting earlier events (token limits)
 - handling combat
 - introducing skill checks
